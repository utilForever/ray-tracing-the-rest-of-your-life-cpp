<img src="./result.png" />

This repository is C++ implementation of Peter Shirley's [Ray Tracing: The Rest of Your Life](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheRestOfYourLife.html). The code is built on C++17 and can be compiled with commonly available compilers such as g++, clang++, or Microsoft Visual Studio. It currently supports macOS (10.14 or later), Ubuntu (18.04 or later), Windows (Visual Studio 2017 or later), and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Other untested platforms that support C++17 also should be able to build it.
